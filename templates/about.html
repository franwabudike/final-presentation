                <h1>Welcome to VibeRoom ðŸŽµ</h1>

                <p>
                    Studying doesnâ€™t have to be silent or stressful. Over <strong>90% of students</strong> say music helps them manage stress and stay focused, 
                    but finding the right playlist for your mood or task isnâ€™t always easy. Thatâ€™s where VibeRoom comes in.
                </p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    VibeRoom helps students unlock the power of sound by curating mood-based music playlists tailored to how you're feeling
                    whether you're grinding out a paper, unwinding after exams, or teaming up in a group study session.
                </p>

                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <p>
                    Just choose your current <strong>vibe</strong>: Focused, Chill, or Energized and weâ€™ll match you with playlists that help boost 
                    concentration or promote relaxation. You can even filter by mood or weather to listen when you feel most comfortable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Want to study together? VibeRoom also supports group rooms where you and friends can sync up and listen to the same playlist at the same time.
                </p>

                <h2>Why It Matters?</h2>
                <p>
                    According to <a href="https://www.fnu.edu/benefits-studying-music/" target="_blank">multiple studies</a>, the right kind of music can improve memory, 
                    reduce anxiety, and enhance learning. VibeRoom makes it easier to access those benefits all in one click.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whether you're cramming for finals or winding down before bed, VibeRoom helps you find your perfect study vibe effortlessly.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Letâ€™s make studying something you look forward to! ðŸŽ¶</strong></p>
